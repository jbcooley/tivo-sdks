= Tivo.Hme and Tivo.Hme.Host Change Log =

*1.1 Feb 13, 2008*

  * Added support for custom icons
  * More robust socket code so that a read that doesn't retrieve all expected data retries until all expected data is received.
  * Automatically dispose all attached views when the application exits.
  * Fix out of order resource creation in a TextView with child ColorViews.
  * Reorder view initialization with calls to child view OnNewApplication not happening until the child view is fully initialized.
  * Check for end of stream in reading lines from HTTP requests.  This fixes a possible infinite loop and unbounded memory growth.
  * Added overload for Application.CreateTextStyle that takes a callback that gets called only for this font creation.

*1.0.1 Jan 29, 2008*

 * Fix exception thrown because of a missing icon.
